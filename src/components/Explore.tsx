          <p className="mt-1">
          It’s almost stereotypical to put Niagara Falls on a list of the most beautiful places in the world, but it is magnificently stunning. This natural wonder is made up of three separate waterfalls with a maximum drop of almost 200 feet.

          Yes, the entirety of the capital of Sweden is on our list of the most beautiful places in the world, not only because it’s home to multiple UNESCO World Heritage Sites, but because it has that storybook charm you can rarely find anywhere else. Stockholm is a picturesque destination with both old and modern architecture, a rich history, cobblestone streets, and the calming presence of water in an urban setting. There’s so much to do and so many places to shop, we can only warn you that you probably won’t want to ever leave.</p>

          It only takes a quick glance to see that Mostar, Bosnia, is one of the most beautiful places in the world. Beauty aside, it also has a rich—albeit painful—history. And while it looks like it dates back to medieval times, it was actually erected in 2004 as a reconstruction of the original city, which was 400 years old when it was destroyed in the 1990s during the Croat-Bosniak War.</p>
